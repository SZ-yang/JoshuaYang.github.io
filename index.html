			                <p> I am a Master's student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, holding a Bachelor's degree in Data Science with a minor in mathematics from New York University. My past experiences include working as a research assistant at NYU under Professor Manpreet Katari. In this role, I developed a Python-based statistical model using the Generalized Linear Model of the negative binomial distribution for analyzing gene differential expression. Currently, I am exploring the use of Contrastive Learning methods to understand the low-dimensional representation of static lineage barcoded single-cell RNA-seq data, supervised by Professor Kevin Lin at the University of Washington. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging domain science, statistical models and programmatic data analysis. </p>

    <strong><a href = "https://github.com/SZ-yang/SCSeq_LineageBarcoding">Deep-learning embedding for static lineage barcoded single-cell RNA-seq data</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Designed and implemented a contrastive learning algorithm to learn the high-dimensional embeddings of static lineage barcoded single-cell RNA-seq data, facilitating the identification of lineage-specific gene expression patterns. </li>
		            <li> Develop an evaluation metric for comparing the performance of different embeddings of single-cell data generated by the model.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Python-based RNA-seq Analysis Algorithm using Negative Binomial GLM</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li>Build a python-based Stats Model based on GLM with negative binomial distribution for geneâ€™s differential expression analysis.</li>
		<li>Use backtracking line search in dispersion estimation and IRLS (iterative reweighted least squares) in coefficient estimation and apply the Wald Test to the estimated log fold changes.</li>
    <li>Test the algorithm on several different datasets and compare the results with actual and estimated values generated by Deseq2.</li>

		<strong><a href = "https://github.com/SZ-yang/SIRV_Model_2022_NYC_Influenza">Refined SIR Model with Vaccination and its Application in 2022 NYC Influenza A Activity Prediction</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Implemented a series of ODE methods (including fixed point and its stability, phase plane, and Herd Immunity) to analyze the modified SIR model with the consideration of  Vaccination analytically. </li>
		<li> Simulated the NYC influenza data of the past six years using the SIRV model and estimated the transmission rate, removal rate, and reproduction number (R0) using the Quasi-Newton method on Python.</li>
		<li> Compared the estimated coefficients of the past seasons and predicted the infection peak in NYC this year under different vaccination rates.</li>
